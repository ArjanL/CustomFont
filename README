CustomFont is a simple Ruby Class for generating images with text in
a custom font using rMagick. You can quickly replace any tag,
especially h1, h2, h3 an p by the image without losing the tags string
content.

Install ImageMagick.

Bundle rmagick with your Railsapp.

Create the dir "custom_font" in $railsapp/public/images/ and chmod
it according to your rails user rights.

Download custom_font.rb and put it into $railsapp/config/initializers/.

In the same dir, add an initializer called "constants.rb":
MAIN_FONT = "Tahoma-Bold"

To get a list of available Fonts, and their names, hit
>> convert -list font
on the same machine.

Go into your ApplicationHelper and add this method:
	def custom_font(text="CustomFont", tag="h1")
		case tag
			when "h1"
				pt = CustomFont.pt_h1
			when "h2"
				pt = CustomFont.pt_h2
			when "h3"
				pt = CusomtFont.pt_h3
			else
				pt = CustomFont.pt_p
		end
		CustomFont.new(text, MAIN_FONT, pt, tag).to_s
	end

Go into any View you like and type:
<%= custom_font "My Text", "h1" %>

By looking at the custom_font.rb file, you will see how simple it works.

You will find a class called CustomFont, with the following constructor:
def initialize(text="CustomFont", font="Verdana-Bold", pt=PT_H1, tag="h1", kill=false, root_dir="public/images/custom_font/", url="/images/custom_font/")
text: What text to render.
font: What font to use.
pt: Font-size in point.
tag: what tag to replace.
kill: Delete the image file, if our instance gets destroyed by the GC?
root_dir: path to the only dir, CustomFont requires, from the view of the File-Class.
url: path to the images, same path as root_dir but from the view of the browser.
